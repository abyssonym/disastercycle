--- HOW TO USE ---
    Running the randomizer:
        Windows users may use the executable file, "sj_disastercycle.exe". Other users, please run "randomizer.py" using Python version 2.7.

    Compatible with the following roms for NDS:
        SMT SJ NA       47cfc1ef624ea3a43f1aa0a49d551d1a

    This randomizer has the following flags:
        e  Randomize enemy stats.
        f  Randomize demon races (fusion recipes) and alignments.
        n  Randomize nakama (demon allies).
        s  Randomize demon skills.

    Additionally, the level of randomness can be adjusted to your preference. A value of 0 changes virtually nothing, a value of 1 is extremely unbalanced (i.e., final boss stats in Antlia), and 0.5 is the recommended, default setting.
